       "review": "This blender is not superior to other smoothie blenders, It doesn't pulverize seeds and leaves green smoothies chunky with a lot of pulp. The single serve concept is amazing, however, my single serve cup began to break right from the start. The prongs became chipped because of the difficulty of screwing it in and out of the base. It won't blend for more than a minute without smelling like burned rubber. While the single serve seemed to blend more smoothly, it didn't hold much, especially when adding ice. I was very disappointed and so I returned it,",

       "review": "I am blown away by this blender. It obliterates ice and frozen fruit - and blends fresh fruits to smooth perfection. It even makes quick work of fresh ginger and tough greens. I did a ton of research before settling on the Ninja. This was a splurge for me - and I spent the extra money to get the single serve cups, thinking I'd take my smoothie to work every morning. But my husband is totally hooked on smoothies now too, so the big pitcher is getting regular use. Tried it out for margaritas tonight... half a lime, half a lemon, half an orange with tequila, honey and ice... unbelievably good. Haven't tried it for soup or sauce yet, but can hardly wait.\n\nI'm impressed by features such as the suction cup feet, the snap-seal lid, and the sensor that prevents the machine from being turned on without the top in place. It cleans up nicely too. \n\nBottom line: I can't stop raving about this thing and have recommended it to all my friends and family.",

       "review": " Upon using this blender  it turns out that the food gets into a deep hole at the bottom of the blade assembly , which fits on top of the rotating spindle, which cannot be cleaned.  No amount of rinsing or dish washer washing can get to it. A special thin and long brush would be required. Such food deposits can quickly become a place for bacteria growth and accumulate soap from dishwasher etc. A radical design change and going back to the drawing board is required, which Ninja would be unwilling to do.  Very poor and harmful product",

       "review": "I have to assume that the negative reviewers received an unfortunate &quot;lemon&quot; blender... that, or they didn't read the instruction manual, because I love my Ninja and definitely recommend it.\n\nI've had this blender for over a year and it still works as wonderfully as the day I bought it. I use it primarily for making smoothies, everything from green monsters to peanut butter protein shakes to frozen fruit &amp; yogurt smoothies with chia seeds on top.\n\nIt's like having Jamba Juice in my kitchen, but without the long line of snap-chatting teenagers.\n\nI frequently use the to-go cups to blend and take with me in the car. If you are in the camp lamenting that it doesn't hold enough, you probably also expect that once blended, it will be as full as you originally (over)stuffed it.\n\nRespect the max fill line, people, or use the full-size blender if you are going for NYC Big Gulp size.\n\nI will say, that if you are looking to seriously juice, this is not the blender for you. \n\nIt might take a little experimentation to get the right ratio of liquid to solid\/frozen for a perfectly smooth blend, but once you figure out what works for you, it's easy!",
